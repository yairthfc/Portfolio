- In the trees package, we created the following classes:
   1.Tree: Represents a tree object in the game world. It handles the creation and management of the t
   ree's structure, including its trunk and branches.
   2.Leaf: Represents a leaf object that is part of a tree. It handles the
   behavior and appearance of individual leaves.
   3.Fruit: Represents a fruit object that can grow on trees. It handles the behavior and appearance of
   individual fruits.
   4.Flora: Manages the creation of multiple trees within a specified range in the game world.

-Relationships Between Classes:
  * The Tree class contains multiple Leaf objects. Each tree manages its leaves, including their creation,
  positioning, and behavior.
  * The Tree class also contains multiple Fruit objects. Each tree manages its fruits, including
   their creation,positioning, and behavior.
  * The Flora class manages multiple Tree objects. It is responsible for creating trees within a
   specified range and adding them to the game world.

-We used the Composite design pattern in the trees package. The Tree class acts as a
 composite object that contains multiple Leaf and Fruit objects. This pattern allows
 us to treat individual leaves and fruits uniformly and managethem as part of the tree structure.
  The Flora class acts as a manager for creating and organizing multiple Tree objects in the game world.
